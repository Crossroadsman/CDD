Certainty-Driven Development
============================

CDD is a new development methodology drawing inspiration from three main areas:
  - Sudden, widespread, catastrophic failures caused by code that did not perform as developers intended (for example, Crowdstrike);
  - Making the most of AI: AI has already shown itself to be capable of enormously increasing the output of software developers, but with the caveat that this code often doesn't work. Moreover, it is often not properly reviewed, and the more productivity we gain from AI, the more impossible becomes adequate human code review. AIs themselves are black boxes and so cannot solve the problem by building better AIs. Instead, we can work with AIs to produce provably correct output which can be deployed safely even without the human code review we aspire to (and which has always been insufficient in any event);
  - The people-focused (rather than domain-focused) philosophical underpinnings of the Free Software movement and the GNU project.

Mission Statement: "To develop and promote mathematically verified software, ensuring certainty and trust in all applications."
